# `aaa`


This Rust program checks whether your C++ source file is in violation of the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#es31-dont-use-macros-for-constants-or-functions) ES.30, ES.31, and ES.32. If so, it enforces them according to the guidelines.

> Scream when you see a macro that isn't just used for source control (e.g., `#ifdef`)
